YumChain - Eat a variety of foods for a bonus

"I don't feel like eating this"

This plugin changes the hunger points system. Eat one of every food to get a bonus of not getting hungry. If you eat the same thing twice, the chain resets. You get a half food point for eating something, then it doubles each time your chain gets longer, and you'll get hungry less.

Requires pxnPluginLib plugin:
